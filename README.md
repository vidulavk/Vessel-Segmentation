This repository demonstrates a concise implementation of semantic segmentation using PyTorch, following the principles outlined in the article Train Neural Net for Semantic Segmentation with PyTorch in 50 Lines of Code. Semantic segmentation involves classifying each pixel in an image, enabling the model to understand and differentiate objects at a pixel level.

Semantic segmentation is a crucial task in computer vision, and this project provides a straightforward yet powerful implementation using PyTorch. The code, contained within a minimal number of lines, focuses on simplicity and clarity. The model architecture, training process, and evaluation are all encapsulated in a concise manner, making it accessible for both learning purposes and practical applications.

USAGE:
1.Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/semantic-segmentation-pytorch.git
cd semantic-segmentation-pytorch
2.Install dependencies
3.Train the model
4.Evaluate the model

The model architecture is defined in model.py. It includes essential components for semantic segmentation, and you can customize it based on your specific needs.

After training, the model's performance can be assessed using the evaluation script. The README in the original article provides a detailed explanation of how to interpret the results and adjust parameters for optimal performance.

Contributions to enhance and extend this PyTorch-based semantic segmentation project are welcome. Feel free to fork the repository, make improvements, and submit pull requests. The project follows the guidelines outlined in the original article.
